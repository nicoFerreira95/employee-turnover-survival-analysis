# Employee Turnover Survival Analysis Project
This repository contains the code and resources for my employee turnover survival analysis project. In this project, I used the employee turnover dataset from Kaggle to explore different survival analysis techniques and models to explain employee churn.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davinwijaya/employee-turnover. It contains information about employee demographics, job information, performance evaluation, and churn status. The target variable in this dataset is whether an employee has churned or not.

## Project Overview
In this project, I explored different survival analysis techniques to explain employee turnover. The project is divided into the following sections:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Feature engineering
* Binary classification problem
* Survival analysis models:
  * Kaplan-Meier model
  * Weibull Accelerated Failure Time model (Weibull AFT)
  * Cox Proportional Hazards model (Cox-PH)
  * Survival Forests
* Model evaluation and comparison
* Conclusion and future work
## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to install the following packages:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* lifelines
You can then run the Jupyter Notebook employee-turnover-survival-analysis.ipynb to reproduce the results and analysis in this project.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how survival analysis techniques and models can be used to explain employee turnover. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection and tuning, we were able to identify factors that contribute to employee churn and predict the probability and timing of churn.

Future work for this project includes exploring more advanced survival analysis models, incorporating more data sources, and performing more rigorous statistical analysis.
